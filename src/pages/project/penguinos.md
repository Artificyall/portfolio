This is a personal project realized with the collaboration of two students of my class, Léo Paillé and Timothée Ballion, in a time of about 1 week.

We used a virtual machine to host the server of our site.

We learned to use regular expressions to find our penguin images.

The API is functional and hosted at : http://www.penguinos.xyz/
