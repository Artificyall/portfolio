Creating a database, filling it and using SQL queries.

I used Processing, Photoshop and algorithmic logic.

The skills implemented: creation of graphic interactivity and graphic elements and implementation of interaction with the user and the environment.

Team work on the creation of a conceptual data model (CDM), a script for filling a database and creation of the model.
