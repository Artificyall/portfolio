  I recreated the mythical game of Pong for my very first school project.

The game was made from a code provided by our teachers.

I used Processing, Photoshop and algorithmic logic.

The skills implemented: creation of graphic interactivity and graphic elements and implementation of interaction with the user and the environment.

The result is a functional game with several game modes available (4 balls and 1 ball), teleportation portals and obstacles randomly placed on the playing field.
